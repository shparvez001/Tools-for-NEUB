# Tools-for-NEUB
This Repository contains some simple tools I developed for NEUB (North East University Bangladesh) during my tenure in NEUB. These tools are intended to be simple and help some workflow.
I have made thsi opensource so that bugs can be found in these and can be fixed even if I am not available.
